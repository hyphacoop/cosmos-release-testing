# Gaia v15 Upgrade Test Results

* **Target version:** `v15.1.0`
* **Starting version:** `v14.2.0`
* **Minimum hardware requirements for stateful upgrade**
  * 8 cores
  * 64GB memory + 32GB swap
* **Recommended hardware requirements for stateful upgrade**
  * 8 cores
  * 128GB memory
  * NVME storage

## Test Summary

Upgrade workflows use two starting points: fresh and stateful genesis.

* Fresh genesis: A genesis file is initialized with three validators and the chain starts at height 1.
  * [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/hyphacoop/cosmos-release-testing/actions/runs/8117108241)
  * [Log archive](./logs-fresh-state.zip)
* Stafeul genesis: A genesis file is periodically exported from a Cosmos Hub node and modified to provide a single validator with a majority voting power so it can start producing blocks on its own.

### v15-specific test details

1. Minimum commission set to 5%
   * `min_commission_rate` staking parameter must be set to `0.05`
   * Validators with <5% prior to the upgrade must have 5% afterwards
2. Minimum deposit
   * `min_deposit_ratio` gov parameter must be set to `0.01`
   * Deposits with <1% of the `min_deposit` parameter amount must not be accepted
3. Voting requirements
   * Voting transactions must not be accepted if the voter has less than 1ATOM staked
4. Unvested funds transfer
   * Vesting account: cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498
     * Account must be a BaseAccount type
     * Community pool balance must increase by at least the unvested amount of the vesting account
